Description: Tools for performing visualization and exploratory analysis for dynamic, discrete-time networks. You can convert a dynamic network into multivariate latent functions for each node via these functions. Then you use the latent functions obtained to carry out community detection, nodal importance identification, and many other tasks on the network.
